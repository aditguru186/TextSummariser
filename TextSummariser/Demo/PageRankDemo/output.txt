The Summary is :  Two escutcheons are all that remain of the Benty Grange hanging bowl.[19] Both escutcheons are framentary.[20][22][32] It appears to have been about half the size of the other two, and may have originally been placed at the bottom of the hanging bowl.[19]  The escutcheons were presumably part of an entire hanging bowl when buried. although a large and intricate chain was found with a cauldron from Sutton Hoo, the Benty Grange chains appear dissimilar.[35] The Benty Grange chainwork was also probably too heavy to have been used to suspend the hanging bowl.
