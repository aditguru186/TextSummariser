Two escutcheons are all that remain of the Benty Grange hanging bowl.[19] They are made of enamelled bronze and are 40 mm (1.6 in) in diameter.[19] They have the same design and plain frames, parts of which survive.[19] Both escutcheons are fragmentary; enough survives of each for the design to be reconstructed,[19] and, because of overlapping segments, for it to be certain that they represent two distinct pieces.[20] Whether they are hook or basal escutcheons is uncertain, but a contemporary watercolour by Llewellynn Jewitt suggests that a hook was present at excavation, and an iron ring, 2 millimetres in width and 16 in diameter, stuck to the back of one fragment may have been part of a suspension chain.[19] The decomposed enamel background appears uniformly yellow to the eye,[21] as it did when excavated.[22][23][24] A yellow-creatures-on-red-background colour scheme has alternatively been claimed,[25][26][27] but no evidence for such a layout has been presented.[21] As sampling of the enamel was not permitted when one of the escutcheons was analysed in 1968, the all-yellow hypothesis is not definitive.[28][note 2]

The reconstructed design shows three ribbon-style creatures resembling dolphins or fish, depicted in and arranged in a circle with each biting the tail of the one in front.[19] The bodies are defined by their outlines.[20] They are limbless, the tails curled in a circle, the jaws long and curved, and slightly ajar; the bitten tails pass under each creature's upper jaw and over its lower, but are missing where one would expect to see them passing through the gap between jaws.[19] Each creature has a small eye shaped like a pointed oval.[19] The outer borders of the discs, the plain frames, and the contours and eyes of the creatures are all tinned or silvered.[19]

Surviving records of the third escutcheon indicate that it was of a different style and size.[19][20] Drawings by Bateman and Jewitt show it with a scroll pattern and small piece of frame.[20][22][32] It appears to have been about half the size of the other two, and may have originally been placed at the bottom of the hanging bowl.[19]

The escutcheons were presumably part of an entire hanging bowl when buried.[19] Nothing else survives.[19] A mass of corroded chainwork discovered 6 feet (1.8 m) away, which survives only in illustrations by Jewitt and descriptions by Bateman,[33][34] is unlikely to be related; although a large and intricate chain was found with a cauldron from Sutton Hoo, the Benty Grange chains appear dissimilar.[35] The Benty Grange chainwork was also probably too heavy to have been used to suspend the hanging bowl.[35]
